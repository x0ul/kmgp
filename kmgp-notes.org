* This file just contains my development notes as I try mightily to get this crap working
  To start out I'm just going to use flask and templates to
  server-side render it all. I don't have enough brain to learn front
  and back end dev at the same time.

  If I later decide to do futher refine, I'll implement the data in
  the templates as an api and use something like React to query it.

* DONE Bootstrap the Basics

* TODO [3/9] Templated Site Prototype
  The idea here is to start with the Flask tutorial and shape it into
  something resembling my internal concept.

** TODO Switch to postgres
** TODO Deploy site
   - Maybe Heroku? A friend of mine is pretty familiar and I can bug him if there are problems.
** TODO Fix issues with timestamps
   - All time should be stored in database/handled as UTC, preferably UNIX epoch seconds
   - Show air dates must be entered and displayed in America/Los Angeles
   - The timezone used to display updated/modified timestamps don't matter quite as much. Might as well also use America/Los Angeles.
** TODO Fix date/time picker
   - Date picker is actually OK, but time picker should be drop-down hours
** TODO Rename Shows->Programs and Episodes->Shows to have parity with https://www.space101fm.org/programs and not confuse DJs.
** TODO Research audio file uploading, cheap and easy is good.
   - B2? Heard good things wrt "bandwidth alliance"

* TODO [0/1] Station Computer Puller Script
** TODO Learn enough about Windows dev to choose a language
