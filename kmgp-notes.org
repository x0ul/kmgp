* This file just contains my development notes as I try mightily to get this crap working
  To start out I'm just going to use flask and templates to
  server-side render it all. I don't have enough brain to learn front
  and back end dev at the same time.

  If I later decide to do futher refine, I'll implement the data in
  the templates as an api and use something like React to query it.

* Templated Site Prototype [5/6]
  The idea here is to start with the Flask tutorial and shape it into
  something resembling my internal concept.

* Bug fixes [1/5]
** TODO Fix issues with timestamps
   - All time should be stored in database/handled as UTC, preferably UNIX epoch seconds
   - Show air dates must be entered and displayed in America/Los Angeles
   - The timezone used to display updated/modified timestamps don't matter quite as much. Might as well also use America/Los Angeles.

   - Date picker is actually OK, but time picker should be drop-down hours
** DONE Rename Shows->Programs and Episodes->Shows to have parity with https://www.space101fm.org/programs and not confuse DJs.
