* This file just contains my development notes as I try mightily to get this crap working
  To start out I'm just going to use flask and templates to
  server-side render it all. I don't have enough brain to learn front
  and back end dev at the same time.

  If I later decide to do futher refine, I'll implement the data in
  the templates as an api and use something like React to query it.

* Bootstrap the Basics [3/3]

* Templated Site Prototype [6/6]
  The idea here is to start with the Flask tutorial and shape it into
  something resembling my internal concept.
** DONE Complete the [[https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/tutorial/][Flask Tutorial (again)]] and get a working prototype

   - B2? Heard good things wrt "bandwidth alliance"
   - Yes, went with B2. Still need to get presigned POSTS working.

* Bug fixes [2/9]
** TODO Fix issues with timestamps
   - All time should be stored in database/handled as UTC, preferably UNIX epoch seconds
   - Show air dates must be entered and displayed in America/Los Angeles
   - The timezone used to display updated/modified timestamps don't matter quite as much. Might as well also use America/Los Angeles.
** TODO Fix date/time picker
   - Date picker is actually OK, but time picker should be drop-down hours
** DONE Rename Shows->Programs and Episodes->Shows to have parity with https://www.space101fm.org/programs and not confuse DJs.
   CLOSED: [2022-04-28 Thu 04:44]
** TODO make it prettier with css
** DONE fix index display to show only scheduled upcoming shows, maybe include an "older shows" expansion?
   CLOSED: [2022-05-02 Mon 08:23]
   Sort of done, didn't pay attention to older shows or timezone data. So still needs some work, but in the details.
** TODO add a way to browse older shows
** TODO properly integrate tailwind css
** TODO make show titles optional, perhaps below air date if not nil
** TODO fix heroku crash on create episode

* Station Computer Puller Script [1/4]

** TODO Create a repo and a package
** TODO Implement querying web backend for upcoming shows
** TODO Implement downloading and renaming
