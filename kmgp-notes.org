* This file just contains my development notes as I try mightily to get this crap working
  To start out I'm just going to use flask and templates to
  server-side render it all. I don't have enough brain to learn front
  and back end dev at the same time.

  If I later decide to do futher refine, I'll implement the data in
  the templates as an api and use something like React to query it.

* TODO Bootstrap the Basics
** DONE Start this org file full of TODOs to have some goals for the project

** TODO Make subdirs and a few READMEs
* TODO [/] Templated Site Prototype
  The idea here is to start with the Flask tutorial and shape it into
  something resembling my internal concept.
** TODO Complete the [[https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/tutorial/][Flask Tutorial (again)]] and get a working prototype
** TODO Modify the tutorial project to make the flaskr posts look more like episodes of a show
** TODO Group the episodes under shows
** TODO Research audio file uploading, cheap and easy is good.
