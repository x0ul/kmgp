* This file just contains my development notes as I try mightily to get this crap working
  To start out I'm just going to use flask and templates to
  server-side render it all. I don't have enough brain to learn front
  and back end dev at the same time.

  If I later decide to do futher refine, I'll implement the data in
  the templates as an api and use something like React to query it.

** DONE Fix issues with timestamps
   CLOSED: [2022-07-02 Sat 13:51]
   - ~All time should be stored in database/handled as UTC, preferably UNIX epoch seconds~ Actually no, use DB time features
   - Show air dates must be entered and displayed in America/Los Angeles
   - The timezone used to display updated/modified timestamps don't matter quite as much. Might as well also use America/Los Angeles.

   - Date picker is actually OK, but time picker should be drop-down hours
